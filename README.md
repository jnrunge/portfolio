# Portfolio

Putting together some examples of on the one hand still private work-in-progress projects and personal learning projects to share what I am working on.

## Learning projects

### Machine learning: Random forests

In this Quarto / RMarkdown document I am playing around with random forest classification in a data set I make up on the fly: [randomforest.html](fake_disease_ml/randomforest.html)

## Partial look into work-in-progress private projects

### 10k+ mice genotyping project

I am currently putting this project out of its organically grown state into a more accessible situation for future work of others and here I am sharing part of semi-automated pipelines that take raw sequencing data from well-covered samples, generate ancestral genotypes ([F0 genotyping](Barn_Mice/01_Genotyping/01_F0)), and then use ultra-low-coverage reads from various sequencing runs, put them all together, and impute genotypes using the ancestral genotypes (not yet fully included): ([Fx genotyping](Barn_Mice/01_Genotyping/01_Fx))
